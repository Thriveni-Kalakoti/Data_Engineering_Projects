# Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains practical projects focused on **data engineering** concepts like **ETL pipelines**, **data cleaning**, **automation**, and **batch processing** using Python and SQL.

## Projects Included

| Project | Description | Tools/Tech |
|--------|-------------|------------|
|CSV to SQLite ETL Pipeline | Built a modular ETL pipeline to extract raw sales data from CSV, perform data validation and cleaning, and load the transformed data into a SQLite database. | Python, Pandas, SQLite, Git, GitHub Actions |

## Project Structure

Each project folder contains:

- `README.md` – Description of what the project solves and how it works
- `.py` scripts or `.ipynb` notebooks – Functional and reusable pipeline code
- `data/` – Sample or synthetic data (if applicable)

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, OS, Glob)
- SQL (SQLite, BigQuery)
- File handling and batch operations
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)
- Automation (scheduled jobs, basic scripting)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Build and simulate **real-time data pipelines**
- Automate data ingestion, transformation, and export processes
- Work with structured and semi-structured data
- Learn clean coding and modular script design
- Understand how data flows in production-like environments

---

## Getting Started

Each project can be run locally with Python 3.8+.  
Notebooks are also compatible with **Google Colab** for ease of use and sharing.

## Notes

- These projects are part of my continuous journey to gain hands-on data engineering experience.
- The code is kept clean, modular, and beginner-friendly with inline comments.
